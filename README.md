Kill Reddit, dead in it's tracks.

## I have a problem

And it's a site called Reddit. If I'm ever bored or have a moment at the
computer, reddit.com shows up in my address bar. I wrote this extension to
block that instant gratification, so I can't mindless go there.

Does this mean I'm weak? Maybe, but it helps.
